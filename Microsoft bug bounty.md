up: [[Bounty Programs]]

# Microsoft bug bounty

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty) is another prominent company that runs a bug bounty program. Microsoft has categorized its bug bounty offerings by platform. This includes:

- Cloud programs
- Platform programs
- Defense and grant programs

The bounties on offer are quite substantial, starting at $15,000 for lesser security flaws in Microsoft.NET and ElectionGuard, and $250,000 for Hyper-V remote execution bugs.

If your research doesn't qualify for a bounty, there is a consolation prize: Microsoft acknowledges all research in their Researcher Recognition Program which can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program).

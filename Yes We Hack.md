# Yes We Hack

[Yes We Hack](https://www.yeswehack.com/) is another bug bounty program that you can use to find bugs. They have a novel approach of rewarding those who submit good reports, helping other hackers learn how to find flaws within products and applications. Yes, We Hack has an extensive list of software applications that are part of its bug bounty program, and the company will apply your name to any bugs that are found.

A lot of the content on their blog is dedicated to getting started with their program and finding vulnerabilities. Some of their conditions are that a security researcher who finds a vulnerability must be the first to report it, and they should do so through this wehttps://www.yeswehack.com/https://www.yeswehack.com/https://www.yeswehack.com/bsite. You can also sign up and find a list of the bounties available on their site. 

You'll need clear evidence of your findings (screenshots or code) along with instructions for reproducing them to qualify for a bounty.

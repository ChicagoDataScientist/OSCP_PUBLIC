# Cryptography Pre Assessment
![[Pasted image 20240609154721.png]]
The correct answer is:

- **Private key of the root CA**: This key is used to sign the certificate issued to the business. The root Certificate Authority (CA) is the trusted third party that issues digital certificates. The private key of the root CA is used to create a digital signature, which verifies that the certificate is legitimate and has not been tampered with.

Incorrect options:

- **Private key of the company**: This key is used by the company to decrypt messages sent to it or to sign messages it sends out. It is not used to sign its own certificate.
- **Public key of the company**: This key is distributed widely and used by others to encrypt messages to the company or to verify signatures made by the company. It is not used to sign certificates.

Please provide the next question when you’re ready.

![[Pasted image 20240609155248.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **Public key of the company**: This key should be sent to potential customers to prove the business’s identity. The public key is part of a key pair that is used in public-key cryptography. The business would use its private key to encrypt a message or a digital signature, and the public key would be used by the recipients (potential customers) to decrypt the message or verify the signature, thus proving the identity of the business.

Incorrect options:

- **Private key of the root CA**: This key is used by the root Certificate Authority to sign certificates, not by businesses to prove their identity.
- **Private key of the company**: This key is kept secret and never shared. It is used to sign or encrypt data that the public key can decrypt or verify.
- **Public key of the root CA**: This key is used to verify the signature on a certificate issued by the root CA, not by businesses to prove their identity.
![[Pasted image 20240609155320.png]]The correct answer is:

- **Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #12**: This standard is used to import and export items written using X.509 that are part of a chain of trust. PKCS #12 is a binary format for storing a certificate chain and private key in a single encryptable file.

Incorrect options:

- **RTF**: This is a text file format and not suitable for cryptographic purposes.
- **Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #7**: This standard is used for signing or encrypting data and certificates, not specifically for exporting and importing a chain of trust.
- **CER**: This is a file extension for X.509 certificates; it does not support private keys or the entire chain of trust.
- ![[Pasted image 20240609155444.png]]
- 
The correct answer is:

- **Thumbprint**: This field displays the hash or digest of the certificate in an X.509 certificate. The thumbprint is a cryptographic hash that is used to uniquely identify a certificate and verify its integrity.

Incorrect options:

- **Subject**: This field contains information about the entity to whom the certificate is issued.
- **Issuer**: This field contains information about the entity that issued the certificate.
- **Version**: This field indicates the version of the X.509 certificate format.
![[Pasted image 20240609155541.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **Initialization**: This certificate management process involves key recovery. Initialization is the process where a system or application is set up with the necessary keys and certificates. During this process, key recovery can be established to allow for the retrieval of encryption keys in case they are lost or compromised.

Incorrect options:

- **Hold**: This refers to temporarily suspending a certificate’s validity without revoking it.
- **Cancellation**: This is another term for revocation, which permanently ends a certificate’s validity.
- **Issued**: This simply indicates that a certificate has been created and given to a user.
![[Pasted image 20240609155626.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **Signing it with its private key**: A root CA performs the task of signing its own certificate with its private key before publishing it. This digital signature ensures that the certificate is authentic and has not been altered.

Incorrect options:

- **Encrypting it with its private key**: A root CA does not encrypt its own certificate with its private key; encryption with a private key is not a standard practice for publishing certificates.
- **Signing it with its public key**: A root CA cannot sign a certificate with its public key because signatures are created with the private key to ensure authenticity.
- **Encrypting it with its public key**: Certificates are not encrypted with a public key; they are signed to verify their authenticity.
![[Pasted image 20240609155735.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **SHA-1**: This algorithm is used to generate the thumbprint of a certificate. SHA-1 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 1, and it produces a hash value that is typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. It’s commonly used to verify data integrity.

Incorrect options:

- **RSA**: This is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used for encryption and digital signatures, not for generating thumbprints.
- **3DES**: This stands for Triple Data Encryption Standard, which is a symmetric-key block cipher, not a hashing algorithm.
- **AES**: This stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, which is also a symmetric-key algorithm used for encrypting data, not for hashing.
![[Pasted image 20240609155828.png]]
The correct answer is:

- **Encrypt by using symmetric keys and distribute by using asymmetric keys**: For large volumes of plaintext, symmetric keys are used for encryption because they are faster and more efficient. Asymmetric keys, which include a public and private key pair, are used for secure key distribution. The public key can be shared openly to encrypt the symmetric key, which only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt.

Incorrect options:

- **Encrypt by using asymmetric keys and distribute by using symmetric keys**: Asymmetric encryption is not typically used for large volumes of data due to its slower speed and inefficiency compared to symmetric encryption.
- **Encrypt by using symmetric keys and distribute by using symmetric keys**: Distributing symmetric keys securely is challenging without an initial secure channel.
- **Encrypt by using asymmetric keys and distribute by using asymmetric keys**: While possible, this method is not practical for large volumes of data due to the inefficiency of asymmetric encryption for such purposes.
- ![[Pasted image 20240609155917.png]]


The correct answer is:

- **A public key is used for encryption, and a private key is used for decryption**: In asymmetric encryption, the public key is used to encrypt data, ensuring that only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt and access the information. This method allows secure communication between parties who have not shared secret keys in advance.

Incorrect options:

- **A private key is used for both encryption and decryption**: This is not typically how asymmetric encryption works. The private key is meant to be kept secret and is used for decryption or signing, not for general encryption.
- **A public key is used for both encryption and decryption**: The public key is only used for encryption or verifying signatures, not for decryption.
![[Pasted image 20240609160004.png]]
The correct answer is:

- **Digital signature**: A security analyst uses a digital signature to validate the integrity and authenticity of a data transaction. A digital signature ensures that the data has not been altered in transit and verifies the identity of the sender.

Incorrect options:

- **Symmetric encryption**: This is used for encrypting data but does not provide a mechanism for non-repudiation, which is a key aspect of digital signatures.
- **Digital certificate**: While a digital certificate contains a public key and establishes the identity of the holder, it is not used to validate individual data transactions.
- **Asymmetric encryption**: This is used to encrypt data so that it can only be decrypted by the intended recipient, but it does not by itself validate the integrity and authenticity of a data transaction.

![[Pasted image 20240609160058.png]]
The correct answer is:

- **Certificate authority (CA)**: A Certificate Authority is the PKI component that generates digital certificates. It is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates, which are used to verify the identity of organizations and encrypt data.

Incorrect options:

- **Certificate signing request (CSR)**: This is a request sent by an entity to a CA to apply for a digital identity certificate.
- **Certificate revocation list (CRL)**: This is a list of certificates that have been revoked by the CA before their scheduled expiration date and are no longer trusted.
- **Certificate policy (CP)**: This outlines the different classes of certificates issued by the CA and their validation procedures.

128 bits: The WEP protocol uses encryption keys that are a maximum of 128 bits in length. While WEP initially supported keys of 64 bits, it was later updated to allow for keys of 128 bits to provide stronger security, although WEP is still considered to be a weak encryption standard compared to more modern protocols like WPA2 or WPA3.

The correct answer is:

- **128 bits**: The WEP protocol uses encryption keys that are a maximum of 128 bits in length. While WEP initially supported keys of 64 bits, it was later updated to allow for keys of 128 bits to provide stronger security, although WEP is still considered to be a weak encryption standard compared to more modern protocols like WPA2 or WPA3.
![[Pasted image 20240610074603.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **Support for an authentication server**: WPA-Enterprise differs from WPA-Personal mainly in its support for an authentication server. WPA-Enterprise uses an authentication server (like RADIUS) to authenticate each user individually, which is more secure and scalable for larger organizations.

Incorrect options:

- **Use of a session key**: Both WPA-Enterprise and WPA-Personal use session keys.
- **Use of a 48-bit initialization vector**: Both versions use a 48-bit initialization vector.
- **Support for Temporal Key Integrity Protocol**: Both WPA-Enterprise and WPA-Personal support TKIP.

Please send the next question whenever you’re ready.

![[Pasted image 20240610074647.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **RC4**: The cipher used with WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is RC4. RC4 is a stream cipher that was widely used in the early Wi-Fi security protocols, including WEP, to encrypt data over wireless networks.

![[Pasted image 20240610074705.png]]
The correct answer is:

- **Hashes the initialization vector and secret key**: TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) improves WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) over WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) by hashing the initialization vector with the secret key, which provides better security by ensuring that each key is unique and by preventing key reuse.
![[Pasted image 20240610074732.png]]

The correct answer to the question is:

- **At both the headquarters and the offsite location**: In IPsec tunnel mode with ESP, the packets are encrypted as they travel through the tunnel between the corporate office and the remote office. Therefore, they can only be inspected by intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and virus scanners at the endpoints where the packets are decrypted, which are the headquarters and the offsite location.

Incorrect options:

- **Only at the headquarters**: This option is incorrect because it does not include the offsite location where the packets can also be inspected after decryption.
- **Between the headquarters and the offsite location**: This option is incorrect because the packets are encrypted in the tunnel and cannot be inspected in transit.
- **Only at the offsite location**: This option is incorrect because it does not include the headquarters where the packets can also be inspected after decryption.

![[Pasted image 20240610075057.png]]

The correct answer to the question is:

- **UDP 500**: This is the default port that must be open for the IPsec key exchange, specifically for the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, to be successful.

Incorrect options:

- **UDP 162**: This port is commonly used for SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) traps.
- **TCP 389**: This port is used for LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
- **TCP 465**: This port is often used for SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure).

![[Pasted image 20240610075128.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **51**: The protocol number that indicates the VPN is using Authentication Header (AH) is 51. AH is a part of the IPsec suite and provides data integrity and authentication for IP packets.

Incorrect options:

- **48**: This is not a protocol number associated with IPsec or AH.
- **50**: This protocol number is associated with Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), another part of IPsec that provides data privacy.
- **58**: This is the protocol number for ICMPv6, which is used for error messages and operational information in IPv6 networks.
![[Pasted image 20240610075215.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **Bifid**: The Bifid cipher uses a grid, known as the Polybius square, to map letters into numeric values. This allows for both fractionation and transposition in the encryption process, which provides a higher level of security.

Incorrect options:

- **Caesar**: This cipher involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a set number of places and does not use a grid.
- **SHA-1**: This is a cryptographic hash function and not a cipher; it does not use a grid to map letters.
- **Vigenère**: This cipher uses a keyword to create a series of Caesar ciphers but does not use a grid to map letters into numeric values.

![[Pasted image 20240610075239.png]]

The correct answer is:

- **Playfair**: The Playfair cipher uses a five-by-five matrix with nonrepeating characters for encryption. It treats digraphs in the plaintext as single units and translates these units into ciphertext digraphs.

Incorrect options:

- **Rail code**: This cipher involves writing the plaintext in a zigzag pattern on an imaginary fence, hence the name.
- **Pigpen**: This cipher uses a substitution alphabet made of grids and dots, but not a five-by-five matrix.
- **Vigenère**: This cipher uses a keyword to create a series of Caesar ciphers but does not use a five-by-five matrix.
![[Pasted image 20240610075324.png]]

The correct answer to the question “What does a frequency analysis attack to break encryption involve?” is:

**A) Analyzing ciphertext to identify text variation and comparing the text to standard English characters**

- **Explanation**: Frequency analysis is a technique used in cryptanalysis where the attacker studies the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a piece of ciphertext. The idea is to compare these frequencies to those of standard English (or another language) to guess the possible plaintext. For example, in English, the letter ‘E’ is the most common, so a high frequency of a particular character in the ciphertext might suggest it corresponds to ‘E’.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **B) Identifying part of the ciphertext and the corresponding plaintext** refers to a known-plaintext attack, not frequency analysis.
- **C) Performing an exhaustive search to attempt every possible mapping or key** describes a brute-force attack.
- **D) Interfering between two parties and sometimes intercepting or modifying data in the communication stream** is related to a man-in-the-middle attack.

![[Pasted image 20240610075436.png]]

The correct answer to the question “Which technique should a security analyst use to determine the key length in a Vigenère cipher?” is:

**A) Kasiski examination**

- **Explanation**: The Kasiski examination is a method used to attack polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, like the Vigenère cipher. It involves looking for repeating sequences of characters in the ciphertext, which can reveal the length of the key used to encrypt the message. Once the key length is known, frequency analysis can be applied to each column of the transposition to determine the actual key.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **B) Known plaintext** is a type of attack that requires the attacker to have access to both the plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext.
- **C) Frequency analysis** is used to break simpler ciphers like the Caesar cipher by analyzing the frequency of letters, but it’s not effective on its own for determining key length in a Vigenère cipher.
- **D) Brute force** is a method where the attacker tries every possible key until the correct one is found, which is not practical for determining key length.

![[Pasted image 20240610075535.png]]
The correct answer to the question “What is 29 mod 12?” is:

**B) 3**

- **Explanation**: The modulo operation, denoted as ‘mod’, calculates the remainder of the division of one number by another. In this case, ( 29 \mod 12 ) is asking for the remainder when 29 is divided by 12. Dividing 29 by 12 gives 2 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, ( 29 \mod 12 = 3 ).

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) 0** would mean that 29 is evenly divisible by 12, which it is not.
- **C) 5** and **D) 7** are not the remainders of the division of 29 by 12.

![[Pasted image 20240610075557.png]]
The correct answer to the question “Which type of cipher is ChaCha?” is:

**B) Stream**

- **Explanation**: ChaCha is a type of stream cipher. It is designed to provide high-speed cryptographic encryption and decryption by generating a keystream which is then combined with the plaintext (for encryption) or ciphertext (for decryption). Stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, and ChaCha is well-regarded for its performance and security.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) Block** ciphers encrypt data in fixed-size blocks rather than streams.
- **C) Asymmetric** ciphers involve public and private keys for encryption and decryption, which is not the case with ChaCha.
- **D) Hash** functions are used to create a fixed-size hash value from data, but they do not encrypt or decrypt.

Please send the next question whenever you’re ready.

![[Pasted image 20240610075637.png]]

The correct answer to the question “What is the key size for RC4 with WEP?” is:

**A) 40 bits**

- **Explanation**: RC4 is a stream cipher that was used in the WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) protocol for wireless network security. The original implementation of WEP used a 40-bit key size, which was relatively short and subsequently found to be vulnerable to various attacks. Later implementations allowed for larger key sizes, but the standard key size for RC4 with WEP is 40 bits.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **B) 128 bits**, **C) 256 bits**, and **D) 512 bits** are not the standard key sizes for RC4 when used with WEP.
![[Pasted image 20240610075705.png]]

The correct answer to the question “Which symmetric encryption technique uses a 56-bit key size and a 64-bit block size?” is:

**B) DES**

- **Explanation**: DES, or Data Encryption Standard, is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. It uses a 56-bit key size and operates on 64-bit blocks of data. Although it was widely used and standardized, it is now considered to be insecure due to the small key size, which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) 3DES** is a variant of DES that applies the encryption process three times, using two or three different keys for a more secure encryption.
- **C) AES** uses key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
- **D) IDEA** uses a 128-bit key size.

![[Pasted image 20240610075721.png]]

The correct answer to the question “Which wireless security standard uses a 128-bit RC4 stream cipher for encrypted communications?” is:

**C) WEP**

- **Explanation**: WEP, or Wired Equivalent Privacy, is the wireless security standard that uses a 128-bit RC4 stream cipher for encrypted communications. It was part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard. However, WEP has been found to have several security flaws and is now considered to be insecure.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) WPA** uses TKIP or AES-based encryption, which is different from RC4.
- **B) VPN** is not a wireless security standard but a technology that creates a safe and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.
- **D) GSM** is a standard for mobile phone communications, not specifically for wireless security, and it does not use RC4.
![[Pasted image 20240610075741.png]]
The correct answer to the question “Employee B sends Employee A an encrypted message. What does Employee A use to decrypt the message from Employee B?” is:

**D) Employee A’s private key**

- **Explanation**: In a public key encryption system, each user has a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is shared with others, while the private key is kept secret. When Employee B sends an encrypted message to Employee A, they use Employee A’s public key for encryption. To decrypt this message, Employee A must use their own private key, which is the only key capable of decrypting messages encrypted with their public key.

![[Pasted image 20240610075900.png]]

The correct answer to the question “What is an example of a symmetric algorithm?” is:

**B) AES**

- **Explanation**: AES, or Advanced Encryption Standard, is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe. It encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits) and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Symmetric algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) SHA** and **D) MD5** are hashing algorithms, not encryption algorithms. They generate a fixed-size hash value from data but do not encrypt or decrypt.
- **C) RSA** is an asymmetric algorithm that uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
![[Pasted image 20240610075922.png]]
The correct answer to the question “Which two components involved in performing encryption are known to the party that will perform decryption before symmetric encryption is applied?” is:

**Cryptographic Key** and **Cryptographic Algorithm**

- **Explanation**: In symmetric encryption, both the encryption and decryption processes use the same cryptographic key. Therefore, the party that will perform decryption must know the key in advance. Additionally, both parties must know which cryptographic algorithm is being used, as it dictates how the key will be applied to encrypt and decrypt the message.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **Plaintext content** is what is encrypted and is not known before decryption.
- **Initialization vector** and **Nonce value** are used to provide randomness and are not necessarily known before encryption is applied.

![[Pasted image 20240610075938.png]]

The correct answer to the question “Employee A created a secret key and wants to send it to Employee B without any coworkers being able to decrypt the message. Which key needs to encrypt the message?” is:

**B) Employee B’s public key**

- **Explanation**: In public key cryptography, each person has a pair of keys: a public key, which is shared with others, and a private key, which is kept secret. To ensure that only Employee B can decrypt the message, Employee A should encrypt the message using Employee B’s public key. Then, only Employee B’s private key, which is known only to Employee B, can decrypt the message.

![[Pasted image 20240610075956.png]]
The correct answer to the question “What happens to the hash of a file if it is rehashed after the first character of the file is changed?” is:

**A) The entire hash is different**

- **Explanation**: Hash functions are designed to be sensitive to any change in input data, no matter how small. Changing even a single character in a file will result in a completely different hash value. This property is known as the avalanche effect, which ensures that the output hash does not reveal any information about the input data and that even the smallest change is reflected in the output.
![[Pasted image 20240610080009.png]]
The correct answer to the question “What is the length (in bits) of an MD5 hash output?” is:

**C) 128**

- **Explanation**: MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It’s commonly expressed as a 32-digit hexadecimal number.

![[Pasted image 20240610080035.png]]

The correct answer to the question “How many characters are used in an LM hash password?” is:

**C) 14**

- **Explanation**: The LM hash, also known as LAN Manager hash or LanMan hash, is a compromised password hashing function that was used by Microsoft LAN Manager and early versions of Windows. It splits the password into two 7-character chunks, each of which is hashed separately, leading to a total of 14 characters.

Please provide the next question whenever you’re ready. If you have any further questions or need clarification on any topic, feel free to ask!

![[Pasted image 20240610080102.png]]

The correct answer to the question “What is used to store this password?” with the given Windows credential is:

**D) NTLM**

- **Explanation**: NTLM (NT LAN Manager) is a suite of Microsoft security protocols intended to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to users. The alphanumeric string provided in the question is indicative of an NTLM hash, which is used to store Windows passwords.
![[Pasted image 20240610080136.png]]
The correct answer to the question “What is a rainbow table?” is:

**B) Precompiled list of hash values**

- **Explanation**: A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, primarily for cracking password hashes. Tables are used to perform a time-memory tradeoff, where the time to crack a password is reduced by using precomputed values stored in the table. The table contains the hash values for a range of possible inputs, allowing quick lookup to determine what input produces a particular hash.

![[Pasted image 20240610080207.png]]

The correct answer to the question “Which mode encrypts each group with the same key, leaving each group independent of the others?” is:

**C) ECB (Electronic Codebook)**

- **Explanation**: ECB mode encrypts each block of data independently using the same key. This means that identical plaintext blocks will produce identical ciphertext blocks, making it less secure compared to other modes that introduce dependencies between blocks.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) OFB (Output Feedback)**: In OFB mode, each ciphertext block is created by encrypting the previous ciphertext block and then combining it with the plaintext. This creates a dependency between all blocks.
- **B) CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This means that each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point.
- **D) CFB (Cipher Feedback)**: In CFB mode, the previous ciphertext block is encrypted and then combined with the current plaintext block to produce the current ciphertext block. This also creates a dependency between all blocks.
![[Pasted image 20240610080255.png]]

The correct answer to the question “Which mode of block encryption results in the same outcome for matching blocks of a plaintext message?” is:

**C) ECB (Electronic Codebook)**

- **Explanation**: ECB mode encrypts each block of data independently using the same key. This means that identical plaintext blocks will produce identical ciphertext blocks, making it less secure compared to other modes that introduce dependencies between blocks.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) OFB (Output Feedback)**: In OFB mode, a feedback mechanism is used where the output of the encryption algorithm is fed back into the algorithm itself to encrypt the next block. This mode does not produce the same outcome for matching blocks of plaintext.
- **B) CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: CBC mode uses an initialization vector (IV) and chains the encryption process, so each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This mode also does not produce the same outcome for matching blocks of plaintext.
- **D) CFB (Cipher Feedback)**: Similar to OFB, CFB mode also uses a feedback mechanism, but it encrypts the previous ciphertext block and then XORs it with the current plaintext block. This mode does not produce the same outcome for matching blocks of plaintext either.

ECB mode’s lack of dependency between blocks can lead to patterns being visible in the ciphertext when the same plaintext blocks are encrypted, which is why it’s generally not recommended for use in security-critical applications.

![[Pasted image 20240610080327.png]]

The correct answer to the question “How does CBC mode encryption function?” is:

**C) Uses an initialization vector (IV) to encrypt the first block, then uses the result of the encryption to encrypt the next block.**

- **Explanation**: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode is a type of block cipher that uses an initialization vector (IV) to encrypt the first block. The ciphertext from each encrypted block is then used as the input for the encryption of the next block. This creates a chain of dependencies across all the blocks, meaning that the same plaintext will result in different ciphertexts based on its position in the data stream.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) Uses a self-synchronizing stream on the blocks, where the initialization vector (IV) is encrypted and XORed with the data stream.** This describes a stream cipher mode like CFB (Cipher Feedback) or OFB (Output Feedback), not CBC.
- **B) Encrypts each block with the same key, where each block is independent of the others.** This describes ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, not CBC.
- **D) Converts from block into stream, then uses a counter value and a nonce to encrypt the data.** This describes a stream cipher mode like CTR (Counter), not CBC.

![[Pasted image 20240610080410.png]]
The correct answer to the question “Which encryption mode always produces the same result for the same plaintext?” is:

**B) ECB (Electronic Codebook)**

- **Explanation**: ECB mode encrypts each block of data independently using the same key. This means that identical plaintext blocks will produce identical ciphertext blocks, making it less secure compared to other modes that introduce dependencies between blocks.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) CTR (Counter)**: CTR mode uses a counter value that is incremented for each block, ensuring that the same plaintext block will not produce the same ciphertext block.
- **C) CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: CBC mode uses an initialization vector (IV) and chains the encryption process, so each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This mode also does not produce the same outcome for matching blocks of plaintext.
- **D) CFB (Cipher Feedback)**: Similar to OFB, CFB mode also uses a feedback mechanism, but it encrypts the previous ciphertext block and then XORs it with the current plaintext block. This mode does not produce the same outcome for matching blocks of plaintext either.

ECB mode’s lack of dependency between blocks can lead to patterns being visible in the ciphertext when the same plaintext blocks are encrypted, which is why it’s generally not recommended for use in security-critical applications. Please provide the next question whenever you’re ready.

![[Pasted image 20240610080438.png]]
The correct answer to the question “Which information protection method has an 80-bit key and operates on 64-bit data blocks?” is:

**A) Skipjack**

- **Explanation**: Skipjack is a symmetric-key block cipher algorithm developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). It uses an 80-bit key to encrypt or decrypt 64-bit data blocks.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **B) DES (Data Encryption Standard)** uses a 56-bit key and operates on 64-bit data blocks.
- **C) Twofish** is a symmetric block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and supports key sizes up to 256 bits.
- **D) IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)** uses a 128-bit key and operates on 64-bit data blocks.

The correct answer to the question “How many transformation rounds does AES use with a 192-bit key?” is:

**B) 12**

- **Explanation**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) uses different numbers of rounds for each key size: 10 rounds for a 128-bit key, 12 rounds for a 192-bit key, and 14 rounds for a 256-bit key. Each round consists of several processing steps that include substitution, permutation, and mixing of the input plaintext and transform it into the final output of ciphertext.

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A) 10** rounds are used for a 128-bit key.
- **C) 14** rounds are used for a 256-bit key.
- **D) 16** is not a valid number of rounds for any AES key size.

The correct answer is **Brute-force**. Here’s the explanation:

- **Brute-force**: This method involves trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and special characters until the correct one is found. It is a very basic but time-consuming attack method that does not rely on any intelligent or systematic approach.
    
- **Rainbow table**: This is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. It is not used for trying every combination like a brute-force attack.
    
- **Birthday**: The birthday attack is a probability method that exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory. It does not involve trying every combination.
    
- **Dictionary**: A dictionary attack uses a list of likely possibilities, such as words from a dictionary, rather than trying every possible combination.

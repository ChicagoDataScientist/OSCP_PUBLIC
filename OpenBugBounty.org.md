Security researchers can find vulnerabilities independently and then report the issue to [Open Bug Bounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org/). They will then contact the compromised resource owner and then facilitate a conversation between parties. From there, the security researcher will deal directly with the site or application owner.

The owner of the compromised resource may show their gratitude to the security researcher in any way they see fit, which is optional. This means that they are not obligated to pay or even thank you for your work— although positive communications are encouraged by Open Bug Bounty. If you would like to check out more details about this project, you can find their brochure [here](https://www.openbugbounty.org/open-bug-bounty/Open%20Bug%20Bounty%20-%20How%20It%20Works.pdf).

# Apple bug bounty
Apple offers a bug bounty program called theÂ [Security Bounty Program](https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/). It outlines five different categories of vulnerabilities, with different values assigned to each depending on its severity to the user and Apple.

iCloud vulnerabilities start at $100,000, and network attacks without user interaction can fetch a cool $1,000,000. The list of security bounties are:

- iCloud
- Device attack via physical access
- Device attack via user-installed apps
- Network attack with user interaction
- Network attack without user interaction

Bounty payments are determined by how much access or execution is gained in the exploit. If someone finds an issue, they get paid according to what level of risk the vulnerability exposes. The level of detail in your submitted report will also change how much you get paid for your discovery.

All security reports with a major impact on users will be looked at for bounty payments even if they are not in one listed category. Bounty payments are decided by Apple and can be for any amount that Apple decides on itself.

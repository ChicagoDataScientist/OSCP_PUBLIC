# Vulnerability Types to Prioritize

 - **Information Disclosure:** These vulnerabilities often have moderate severity but are relatively common, allowing you to find and report them more frequently. They might not pay the highest bounties, but they can help you build up your submission count and reputation quickly.
    
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Depending on the severity, XSS can range from low to high impact. While more challenging to find, a successful XSS submission can significantly boost your reputation.
    
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** These are often easier to find for beginners and can have a moderate impact, making them a good option for building your portfolio.
    
- **Rate Limiting/Input Validation Issues:** These might be considered low-hanging fruit, but they can still contribute to your submission count and show that you're actively testing and reporting vulnerabilities.

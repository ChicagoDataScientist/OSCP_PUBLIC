# My Reputation Strategy

1. **Focus on DoD Programs on HackerOne:** The DoD's responsive program and emphasis on collaboration with ethical hackers make it an excellent starting point for building your reputation.
    
2. **Diversify Within the DoD:** Look for various DoD-related programs on HackerOne, targeting different agencies or systems. This diversification helps you gain exposure to different technologies and security challenges.
    
3. **Prioritize Volume and Consistency:** While the quality of your reports is essential, aim to submit a consistent number of valid vulnerabilities. This demonstrates your activity and commitment to securing the DoD's systems.
    
4. **Engage with the DoD Community:** Participate in forums, discussions, and live hacking events related to the DoD programs. This can help you learn from other hackers, network with DoD security teams, and build your reputation within the community.
    

**Additional Tips:**

- **Don't Neglect Low-Severity Findings:** While high-severity vulnerabilities are ideal, don't dismiss low-severity issues entirely. They still contribute to your overall reputation and show your dedication to comprehensive security testing.
- **Learn from Triage:** Even if a submission is not accepted as a valid vulnerability, pay attention to the feedback provided by the triage team. This helps you refine your skills and understand what issues are most relevant to the DoD.

By focusing on these strategies, you can effectively leverage the DoD programs on HackerOne to build your reputation quickly and demonstrate your value as an ethical hacker to potential employers. Remember, consistency, engagement, and a willingness to learn are key to your success.

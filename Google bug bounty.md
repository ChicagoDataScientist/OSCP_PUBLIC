# Google bug bounty

[Google](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/6625378258649088)Â has a program to reward people who find problems with their websites. The program started in November 2010, and any Google-owned or Alphabet (Bet) subsidiary service that handles sensitive user data is in the scope. it covers the following Google properties:

- *.google.com
- *.youtube.com
- *.blogger.com
- *.verily.com
- *.onduo.com
- *.projectbaseline.com

The Google range of bounties is a bit more modest than Apple or Microsoft's, with some starting as low as $100, and they go as high as $31,337. A complete list of vulnerabilities that they look for include:

- Cross-site scripting
- Cross-site request forgery
- Mixed-content scripts
- Authentication or authorization flaws
- Server-side code execution bugs

For a vulnerability to qualify, it needs to be submitted with an attack plan, so discovering a potential problem is not enough to get a reward. You need to know how to exploit the vulnerability. This also means you cannot submit a vulnerability if there are limitations to what can be done with it. As described before, the scope is only Google sites or services that handle user data.

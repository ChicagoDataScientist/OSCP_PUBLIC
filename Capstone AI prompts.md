Network Reconnaissance – The network was known to host fifty hosts. Of these, only thirty-seven were found on the initial subnet. During the project’s conclusion I was informed that nine of the missing boxes were located in a different subnet not accessible by any of the rooted hosts while the remaining four hosts were not online. Luckily this did not impact the project’s completion as only ten hosts needed to be exploited. After scanning the hosts for open ports and services, I was able to prioritize hosts in an effective manner, particularly focusing on those hosting web servers as they allowed for more information gathering before attempting exploitation. The network topology turned out to be a star, making the network map deliverable unnecessary. Unfortunately, this meant that lateral movement was not needed so there wasn’t an opportunity to refine skills such as ssh port forwarding, evading firewalls, etc. This phase was made more difficult however, by some hosts responding differently to certain scan types. This required additional research on scanning tools such as Nmap to achieve the required results. 2. Enumerate Hosts (External) – This phase was one of the most valuable in the project from a learning standpoint. Throughout my previous penetration testing experience, enumeration was done manually, and standard tools were off limits. This required more time than anticipated as I had to become familiar with tools such as Dirbuster, Metasploit scanners, Vulners, etc. As the project progressed I developed a standard attack process using these tools, which led to speed PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 4 improvement from four hours to root the first host, to ten minutes on the last one (Note: In the report in Appendix A, hosts are listed in order of ascending IP address rather than the order they were accessed). 3. Gain Host Access – This step was generally easier than anticipated. Due to a thoroughly conducted information gathering stage, finding an exploit for a specific service was straightforward. Little time was wasted as it was usually clear what service what intended to be exploited, something that was great in terms of the project timeline, but unfortunately lacking in realism. The most challenging part of this phase was tailoring exploits to specific hosts. Often hosts didn’t support the programming language the script was written in, most commonly C++ or Python. C++ exploits were rarely useful as few boxes had the compilers to use them and compiling on the attacking box is seldom useful. Also, when conducting open-source exploit research, exploits and their proof-of- concepts didn’t follow a standard format, leaving me to determine how the exploit functioned and how to use it. Lastly, this phase provided valuable experience in upgrading limited shell, as one of the most common results of a successful exploit was a limited Netcat shell. These shells were upgraded using either python or a stty workaround, which I learned from an excellent walkthrough here (Ropnop, 2017). 4. Enumerate Hosts (Internal) and Escalate Privileges – This phase introduced me to the most impressive enumeration and escalation tool I have found to date: Linpeas. Linpeas is a shell script that automates nearly every aspect of enumeration and saves countless time performing the repetitive tasks involved in PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 5 searching for escalation vectors such as finding world-writable directories, SUID/SGID binaries, vulnerable system binaries, etc. As I worked through the network and became familiar with other tools, this quickly became my go-to. Finally, because it is a shell script, it is easily copied and pasted onto the target host. This was invaluable in cases where I couldn’t copy files to the target using scp or an http-server, or when targets didn’t support programming languages needed for other scripts. Despite having this tool, this was by far the longest phase of the project, due to issues outlined in the milestone section below. 5. Create Operations Report – The final phase of this project was faster than expected due to numerous screenshots and notes taken throughout the process. In the cases where evidence of certain steps was left out, it was easy to retrace my steps and get the evidence needed. The most time-consuming portion of this task was editing and formatting, removing the steps that were unnecessary in documenting what would eventually be the exploitation vector. Lastly, the task of offering remediation recommendations was unnecessary, as the hosts invariably ran an outdated service version that the respective vendors have since offered patches for. In conclusion, the project was a success. While only ten hosts were required to be exploited to meet the project goal, I was able to root fourteen (Note: For brevity, only twelve are included in the appendix as some were repetitive). When evaluating the larger goal of improving my skills as a penetration tester, the results were even better. This is best evaluated when examining the time to root PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 6 each host, which was reduced by nearly a factor of ten between the first and final three hosts. Review of Other Work The following works provided guidance, perspective, and technical assistance in the implementation of this project: 1) Sample Penetration Test Report: PurpleSec – This sample report highlighted the differences between the commercial penetration test report and the operations report that was used in this project. Because the audiences of the two reports are different, the reports are as well. The emphases of this report are risk evaluation, remediation recommendations, and recommendations for improving the organization’s security policies and systems. These areas receive so much attention because they better serve the purpose of the business paying for the test, risk mitigation and in many cases, legal compliance. Although the technical walkthrough was more valuable when writing the operations report for this project, this guide highlighted the importance of recognizing the audience of any work and tailoring the product to it. Revisiting this report post-project re-emphasized the differences highlighted here, and it motivates me to improve my writing ability and modify my perspective to be able to view information security as business leaders do when necessary (PurpleSec, 2020). 2) Penetration Test Report: Offensive Security – This work filled much the same role as the previous one, but with some important distinctions. Improvements over the previous work included leading the report with an executive summary, more professional formatting, and a more detailed walkthrough of vulnerabilities exploited. When comparing the operations report in Appendix A to this sample report after the PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 7 project’s completion, the differences are staggering. This report’s professionalism reminded me that being a professional penetration tester requires just as much tact, professionalism, and communication ability as it does technical skills (Offensive- Security, 2013). 3) Jerry: Hack the Box Walkthrough: Medium – Though thousands of exploitation walkthroughs are available online, those like this one serve as better examples for those that are not performing a penetration test in a commercial setting. The format is much closer to the operations report that is included in this project, and the documentation describes not just the steps taken, but the author’s thought process from the initial scan to rooting the host. Post-project, this article was more valuable than I anticipated as one of rooted hosts ran the same vulnerable version of Apache Tomcat as the machine in this article (Annie, 2021). 4) Penetration Testing Courseware: Virtual Hacking Labs – In contrast to the first two artifacts, this document provided the majority of the technical guidance used throughout this project. This 500-page document covers common penetration testing tools, research methodology, and example walkthroughs for host exploitation. Most importantly, it taught me how to think like a professional penetration tester using skills like living off the land and thinking outside of the box to develop alternative exploitation methods as well as developing a mental model similar to the “Try Harder” model taught by Offensive-Security (Virtual Hacking Labs, 2022). As the project progressed, I found my coming back to this courseware whenever I got stuck. 5) Upgrading Simple Shells to Fully Interactive TTYs: Ropnop Blog – This blog post was particularly useful in dealing with host 10.16.1.95. The exploit used against this PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 8 host ran only when a user logged into the machine and resulted in a limited Netcat shell that closed after two to five minutes. This gave only a small window to stabilize and upgrade the shell. Most online walkthroughs for shell upgrades only suggested using python to spawn a pseudo-interactive shell, and the host in question didn’t have python installed. Luckily, this wasn’t an issue as this article included alternative solutions including the one used involving using stty on the attacking box (Ropnop, 2017). 6) Linux Privilege Escalation: Hack Tricks: - This website is the unofficial companion tool to Linpeas. As Linpeas generates output and potential escalation vectors, it also provides links to various portions of this page which provides examples of misconfigurations and how they can be exploited. While it covers the basics of privilege escalation such as SUID binaries, it also dives into the more advanced techniques such as modifying paths and exploiting service timers (Polop, 2022). 7) Payloadsallthethings: Swissky – Last but not least, this GitHub repository was the most valuable resource I found prior to Linpeas. This repo is somewhere in between Linpeas and Hack Tricks, listing all of the typical places to check for escalation vectors as well as the code to automate it. It is much less thorough than Hack Tricks, making it more ideal for less-experienced penetration tester who still working through labs and not exposed to hosts with real world difficulty (Swissky, 2022). Changes to the Project Environment Due to the nature of the training network, the project environment was unchanged from a technical standpoint. During the final phase of the project, all hosts were reset to their original, PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 9 vulnerable configurations. In terms of systems, the project was very successful in providing me the experience necessary to develop my own system for penetration testing, while taking guidance from some major industry players. After the project was complete, I provided feedback to those running the network on my expectations vs. experiences, the difficulty level, and what I think would make the environment more helpful in developing cyber operators. Though not part of the project scope, maintaining the project environment with the most realistic, up-to-date challenges is critical to achieving the goal of the environment’s creation. In the bigger picture, the goal of developing penetration testing skills and progressing toward the next step in Cyber Operator pipeline was achieved through gaining experience with critical tools, methodology development, and documentation skills just to name a few. Methodology Throughout this project, I followed the NIST Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment. The NIST breaks penetration testing into four categories, as seen below.

The network topology turned out to be a star, with one subnet having forty-one hosts and the other having nine. Both subnets were centered around the jump box used to access the network. Because of this, making a network map did not serve the end state of rooted more hosts, as lateral movement was not a factor. All hosts were accessible individually from the starting point. Lastly, a star network map with so many hosts would be difficult to read, with all connections only going to one host. Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables Met 1) Perform Network Reconnaissance – this goal served to determine the roadmap for the rest of the project. Network reconnaissance is the first step in the technical portion of any penetration test (Scarfone et al., 2008) . Meeting this goal meant mapping the attack surface and developing a strategy for achieving the next goal. a) Identify network hosts and running services – this objective was the first step in meeting the above goal. Once hosts and services were identified, many more tools become available to gather more information or exploit the hosts. This goal was met using various Nmap scans, with subordinate deliverables documented in the operations report in Appendix A. i) Scan network using ping sweeps/Nmap – this was the primary method of host discovery. Though some systems may not respond to pings, Nmap had other scanning options to identify hosts. ii) Identify host operating systems – though this was a separate deliverable, it was completed in conjunction with service scanning below. PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 14 iii) Document running services and versions – getting complete service information was required before exploits can be considered. Typically, exploits are only effective against specific service versions. The more information that was gathered about services, the greater the chances were of compromising the host. b) Determine network topology – the purpose of this objective was to identify targets that may be used to pivot to otherwise unreachable hosts, as well as develop strategies for lateral movement. This goal was quickly met using Nmap scans, and pivoting was not necessary. i) Create network map using results from objective 1.a. – this deliverable was meant to be a working document that provides a strategic view of the network. This was the only deliverable that was unmet (see above). c) Identify potential attack vectors – this objective served as a springboard in achieving the next project goal. Minutes spent planning saved hours spent working. Attack vectors were documented using screenshots of Nmap scan result, Metasploit scan results, and website home pages and administration portals. i) Perform deep service scans using the Nmap scripting engine – this deliverable provided potential exploitation vectors without targeting specific services for enumeration. ii) Analyze scan results – this deliverable allowed for prioritizing lines of effort as automated tools may generate false results. For example, results of Vulners scanning with Nmap were rarely applicable. PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 15 iii) Determine priority target hosts and services by evaluating host vulnerability – this was the last step in successful network reconnaissance. In the interest of time, hosts were chosen based on expected ease of exploitation. 2) Perform Host Enumeration (External) – the purpose of this goal was to take a deeper dive into services running on the host by interacting with them to obtain more information about the target. a) Enumerate websites (if present) – web servers are a primary exploitation target as their attack surface is typically larger than the rest of the services combined. This objective and subordinate deliverables were met using Nikto, Dirbuster, etc. These deliverables were internal, and not included in the final report. i) Determine file structure using dirbuster – this deliverable was focused on finding vulnerable files and web pages ii) Search for vulnerabilities using Nikto, Metasploit auxiliary scanners, etc – these tools specialize in finding exploits applicable to the specific webserver or web application version iii) Search for misconfigured or vulnerable versions of web applications – this deliverable was the manual counterpart to the previous one. While automated tools can search many exploits quickly, they are also used by network defenders to easily identify and remediate vulnerabilities. iv) Search for admin portals – this deliverable was the primary reason for determining the file structure of the web server. Open-source research can often provide admin portal details faster than automated tools, and without making as much noise on the PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 16 network. Most of the webservers encountered in this test were exploited due to admin portals, with most of them found manually. b) Enumerate services (if present) – though not often as valuable as finding a web server, the objective of enumerating these services was to gain information about the machine’s purpose on the network, and potentially expose vulnerabilities that are both easy to exploit and provide complete system compromise without the need for privilege escalation, such as EternalBlue. Two hosts found during the project were vulnerable to this particular exploit. Ftp servers accessed did not yield significant results. i) Search for files accessible through ftp, smb, etc – many older versions of ftp applications allow anonymous login by default, giving free information to attackers. Likewise, smb is one of the most exploitable services an attacker can find, with Metasploit alone offering over 130 exploits. Completion of this deliverable ensured that I was utilizing all information available to plan their exploitation strategy 3) Obtain Host Access – obtaining a root shell on the remote host is the ultimate goal when attacking any host. Though some vulnerabilities are bad enough to allow an attacker to go from service exploitation to root shell access in one script, most achieve either greater access to a specific service or a shell as a non-root user. This goal focused on the later cases and achieving it granted me some control over the system, allowing me to get more information on the system and begin the privilege escalation process. a) Research exploits – with service information in hand, this objective gave me the tools I needed to potentially take control of them. This objective was nearly always met through Metasploit or Exploit-Db, with other sources making up less than twenty percent of exploits used. PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 17 i) Search for applicable Metasploit modules – this deliverable was the first step because Metasploit modules are user-friendly and require little coding knowledge. The payloads were easily configurable to achieve the desired result. I was able to attempt all relevant Metasploit modules in the time it took to download and run a single exploit script. Though it was efficient, this strategy would not be as effective in the real world, as IDSs and IPSs would likely detect the exploit signatures. ii) Conduct open-source research using exploit-db, google hacking db, etc – this deliverable provided alternative exploits that are often not available in Metasploit. As hosts became more difficult, this was required more often. iii) Modify exploits if necessary – if copying and pasting code from exploit-db was enough to take over a system, network defenders wouldn’t stand a chance. Luckily for them, many exploits require the code to be edited to target certain operating systems, architectures, etc. This deliverable allowed me to more broadly apply the exploits I found and was essential when exploiting non-standard systems or services. b) Deploy exploits – this objective was focused on getting a shell on the system, root or otherwise. This objective took much longer than anticipated, as I was initially unaware of the ability to set Metasploit payloads depending on the target, leading me to dismiss several applicable exploits until revisiting them later. i) Obtain shell access – this deliverable was the expected end state of most exploits and provided internal access to the system. ii) Obtain fully interactive shell, if possible/necessary – upgrading to a fully interactive shell made traversing and interacting with the system much easier and was essential PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 18 in achieving the next goal. This deliverable was made possible due to the Ropnop tutorial referenced in the other works section. iii) Establish persistence if necessary – though long-term access was not a goal of this project, the techniques used to establish persistence were useful in providing other deliverables, such as upgrading shells or providing access after an exploits access window has closed. This was particularly important on the 10.16.1.95 hosts, which resulted in a time-limited shell when exploited. 4) Perform Host Enumeration (Internal) and Privilege Escalation – this was the final goal on each specific target, after which the process up to this point repeated until the project was complete. Successful privilege escalation meant obtaining a root shell on the system granting full control and the ability to hide exploitation artifacts. Enumeration was conducted primarily through Linpeas, while privilege escalation was most often conducted through SUID binaries. a) Identify system users – many exploits grant access as very limited users. This objective served to identify other user accounts on the system that have more privileges and target them to continue privilege escalation. Though this is a very important step in normal penetration testing, the lack of re-used credentials made this less valuable. However, users of services such as websites often reused their credentials for logging into the hosts, often getting my foot in the door. i) Read /etc/passwd or similar file – this file contains all user account names as well as other useful information such as logon shells, group membership and more. Once logged onto the system, lateral movement via accessing another user account was never necessary.

als here is the end. The rest is screenshots and exhibits: PENETRATION TESTING IN THE CYBER TRAINING NETWORK 23 Conclusions The project resulted in fourteen hosts being rooted. Since the evaluation framework put forth in the project proposal required only ten hosts to be rooted, I consider this project to be an overwhelming success. Changes to the project environment were minimal, as the environment will be reset to its original configuration and used for future training. In the bigger picture, the project was also a success in terms of developing the necessary skills to attain Title 50 certification as described in the project’s proposal. After reviewing the project post-completion, I believe that it provided experience that is much more valuable than many industry standard certification exams, including those such as the CISSP, which required much less work. Having the skills to identify vulnerabilities and understand signs of exploitation will make me much more effective on both sides of cyber operations and in my eventual civilian career as well. Project Deliverables Intermediate deliverables were documented in the goals, objectives, and deliverables section above, leaving only the Operations Report as the project’s final deliverable. Due to its length, it was moved to Appendix A, so that it didn’t take over this report’s structure. Also, due to its length, only the most necessary steps are documented here, typically only including scan results, exploitable web portals, the exploit chosen, and proof of root access. This report is intended to allow replication of the exploits used without making it cumbersome to follow. Each screenshot includes a note stating either it’s origin or significance, as appropriate.

Here is another completed project: A. Describe the consensus-based policies developed for the solution to your cybersecurity problem, including standards and practices that were adopted to facilitate implementation of the solution and a description of the cybersecurity problem being addressed. Azure has the capability to enforce written policies within the infrastructure. For example, the Multi-Factor Authentication requirement within the infrastructure can be enforced using Azure Policies. The current list of requirements to be HIPAA compliant in the Azure environment can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/enus/azure/governance/policy/samples/hipaa-hitrust-9-2; management will require the utilization of these templates to bring the organization into compliance. Policies were created to ensure information security, Data Loss Prevention (exfiltration of data), and Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity. The objective is to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability all the time. Policies gave importance to confidentiality and integrity over availability if budgetary constraints or when IT staff must make choices based on conflicting feature sets in the future. Some other policies regarding standards and practices developed are regarding; identity management, network security, redundancy, securing data (Azure offers double encryption for data at rest), application development, monitoring, and auditing. The objective of the migration to Azure was to ensure seamless patch management and to reduce the cost of keeping updated hardware to accommodate the advances in software. To this extent, we leveraged Azure patch management and update management. Azure can help withhold updates if certain updates can break other applications; otherwise, deploying updates are automated. 3 1. Summarize how the solution supports decision-making capabilities and the needs of the environment where the solution was implemented. Azure updates and patches are managed by establishing a scope for machines to be receiving updates and then further managing the scopes. Scan cycles are configured to scan all the machines that are part of the network to be scanned during certain intervals and initiate remediation action to ensure compliance. Systems physically located on-premise and connected to hardware are managed by the update management center, which is currently free due to the preview stage, but can be purchased once deployed for the general public. B. Describe how your solution meets the following cybersecurity assurance criteria: Promotes automation in cybersecurity In an azure environment, automation is available to be leveraged to the maximum extent. Security policies can be enforced through technical means using azure policies. Templates were available from Microsoft to accomplish this task. However, policies can be written from scratch if needed. These policies could be about authentication, data loss prevention, requirements for signing documents, etc. Another aspect of automation is patch management and updates management for on-premise equipment as well as virtual machines located in the cloud. Improves and modernizes security Modernization is the process of bringing an organization to the current information technology best practices and industry standards. In this context, migrating an organization to the cloud environment with the objective of improving performance and streamlining the ability to deploy changes to the general public in an efficient and secure manner. Migration to the cloud ensured that the application was migrated or rebuilt to conform to the current best security 4 practices. (Microsoft, n.d.-b) This modernization in the Azure environment optimized cost management by paying for only the components and services used in the environment, and this cost management is available down to the exact amount of storage or bandwidth used. With management approval engineers can add or remove capabilities as required for a use case in the future. Implements industry-standard security tools and infrastructure or environment Azure is capable of implementing various industry security standards and security features, that includes but not limited to; creating, maintaining and controlling the identity of users, access control using these identities, implementing single sign-on capabilities, multi-factor authentication, monitoring and alerts, data security through encryption at-rest and during transit, web-application firewalls, and network firewalls. (Microsoft, 2023) These Azure services are well integrated within the infrastructure and provide seamless customer and staff operation. Services can be added and removed as needed within the environment and optimize cost management. C. Explain how your solution addresses the following data collection and implementation elements: Collects digital evidence, including data for analysis or forensics Monitoring and analysis services provided within the Azure environment are used to monitor user behavior. Azure data logs provide the digital evidence if required to be used in a court proceeding, and features such as “Legal Hold” can be enabled for a storage destination which ensures that the data is frozen in time as soon as it is written, along with a hash algorithm 5 can prove the integrity of data and chain of custody. A read-only SAS Key allows access to evidence in an auditable manner without any capability to alter the data. (Microsoft, n.d.-a) Implements confidentiality, integrity, and availability For confidentiality, Azure provides three methods for server-side encryption; service-managed keys, customer-managed keys, and service-managed keys in customercontrolled hardware ranging from the easiest to the most complex of implementation. (Microsoft, 2022) Integrity is maintained using a hashing algorithm, just as it would be in an on-premise environment. Availability of the data can depend on two aspects, one is the availability of data from the cloud, and we can set up load balancing and redundancy to ensure that data is available. However, another aspect of accessing data is the connection from the end-user to the cloud, which will depend on the route from the end-user to the cloud and the internet service provider. This aspect remains outside the scope of the cloud provider. D. Explain how your solution investigates and mitigates cybersecurity incidents and crimes within the environment where the solution was implemented. Investigating and mitigating cybersecurity incidents can be a complex endeavor due to the nature of the cloud. Not having access to isolate hardware from the network and digital collection of forensic evidence can be challenging. Azure environment leverages telemetry data from Microsoft for conducting threat intelligence as a safeguard against cyber crimes in their environment. Data flows from Digital Crimes Unit and Microsoft Security Response Center to provide a large amount of data sets on a threat to the Defender for Cloud. Alerts are configured for the administrator to be notified of any changes in machine configuration as well as behavior anomalies. (Microsoft, 2023a) 6 Once positive confirmation is made about the occurrence of a crime, the management will make the decision regarding the course of action. Policy violations and unauthorized changes may generally result in termination of employment or other disciplinary action. However, any violation of the criminal code must be reported to law enforcement agencies as appropriate, and the company will ensure employees will cooperate with any investigation as a result. E. Describe the cybersecurity plans, standards, or procedures that were developed for the solution. Some of the plans and standards that were developed for the Azure solution discuss the plans to create users, machines, and plans for continuous monitoring of the state of configurations. All procedures are directly adopted from Microsoft guides to perform a particular task. Microsoft has published guides that are continuously updated to reflect changes for routine tasks performed in an Azure environment. After the infrastructure was established in the Azure environment, it was continuously monitored for threats and will be continuously monitored for security risks. Monitoring is enabled for all applications in Azure and for all components of applications. 1. Explain how the solution is aligned with cybersecurity initiatives or regulatory compliance in the environment where the solution was implemented. Azure provided a business associate agreement to satisfy HIPAA compliance, but this is not a guarantee that the information is secure. This is because Azure guarantees the security “of” the cloud environment itself, as opposed to security “in” the cloud. Having an agreement in place is different from ensuring proper configuration of the cloud environment and 7 configuration management. Security of the company “in” the cloud is achieved by setting up access controls, auditable logs, file integrity monitoring, and notification of a breach. All the onpremise features are also available in the cloud environment to ensure HIPAA compliance and Risk Management Framework compliance. (Iskra, 2019) One of the procedure developed for this particular solution has to do with establishing identity in the Azure environment. Once a new employee is hired on to the company, human resources will send over pertinent details to IT Staff, who will establish basic identity in the Azure active direcoty. User will be able to request additional roles and privileges with the concurrence of their immediate supervisor. Customer account request is directly received from customer to the IT Staff through the web application itself. However, the identity verification is completed by dental staff during their first visit. 2. Summarize the applications, source code, executable files, tools, installation guides, or user guides developed in conjunction with the solution. Internally developed application manages medical data and scheduling for customers and hospital staff. The web application is deployed on a virtual machine in the Azure environment. Any changes or updates to the application will undergo strict version control and change management to ensure only known, good working versions are deployed to the cloud for public use. There are no client-side executables developed or deployed to client machines because the application is fully operable through a web browser, and requires no additional installation on the client systems. Microsoft environment provides tools required to manage the Azure infrastructure that is available on a subscription basis. Firewalls, Sentinel, and Network Watcher are some of the security tools used to manage the environment, and the user guides for these tools are maintained and provided by Microsoft. However, internal use guides are created for Staff and 8 customers to use the new application in the cloud environment, as well as guides that help navigate the specific Azure products and features available in the current environment. Installation guides and configuration guides for all products under the subscription are provided by Microsoft. Technical Staff will also attend training hosted by Microsoft to be certified in the Azure environment within the year. F. Discuss the post-implementation environment, including new systems implemented, new processes developed, or network diagrams created demonstrating the new infrastructure. Post-migration environment in the cloud consists of a basic Firewall to protect the virtual network, Azure Active Directory service to manage identity service and access management, a virtual machine instance to host the web application, and a back-end SQL database to host the sensitive data. Other components of the network are; an application gateway, Azure sentinel as the security information and event management solution, and a network watcher to analyze the network and alert admins on a real-time basis. Application security group allows scalability in controlling access for an application hosted on virtual machines. 1. Describe the efficiency of the solution. Businesses these days must seek ways to run greener IT infrastructure, if possible while maintaining all other aspects of business requirements and fulfilling their responsibility towards all stakeholders. To this extent, the Azure environment is more than 93% efficient in reducing carbon footprint when compared to maintaining on-premise infrastructure. Azure SLA offers 99.99% uptime making a high availability rate for customers. The subscription model allows management to scale only needed services and computing power on an as-needed basis in a costeffective manner. 9 2. Analyze the new data (e.g., new reports, logs, processes in place) collected, including how the solution will impact business processes. Newly generated data in the cloud environment can be analyzed in ways that could not have been possible before. Azure analysis service and embedded power BI service allow stakeholders to generate reports on all aspects of the infrastructure with any and all data points available. Technical Staff is able to generate performance-based reports, while management can generate cost-based reports to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Accurate and customizable reports will assist management in analyzing the impact of their decisions in a real-time manner and help produce the justification necessary for the decisions they make. 3. Describe the summative evaluation plan, including a plan of action and milestones. Real-world usability of the system has been determined to be on par or improved from the on-premise environment when compared to Azure infrastructure. This analysis is based on page-improved page load times and customer feedback received through Staff. Migration of exchange to web environment is successful as no email loss was reported by employees, and IT staff reports 100% of content has been migrated. All users can access web applications, and all accounts were ported over successfully with zero complaints of inaccessibility. Penetration plan conducted by outside entity shows that the infrastructure is locked down sufficiently to management satisfaction. There were no issues that required mitigation or a plan of action and milestones. Vulnerability analysis conducted by IT Staff also did not show vulnerabilities; perhaps this can be attributed to fresh installation and fully upgraded systems. 10 **** This is part 1 of 2 of this project. Please allow me to send you part 2
```

```
a. Describe any control deficiency analysis resulting from your testing plan. Or if a controlled deficiency analysis was not required, explain why. Systems are continuously monitored, and patches are kept up to date as a control. However, when people are prioritized over process, this can lead to pitfalls. An employee leaving the organization can result in a system not being patched against vulnerability. The process required to get patches tested and approved must be understood by multiple employees. This applies to other user roles as well. All employees are rotated within the department to understand each other’s jobs. While having a subject matter expert is good for any department, management is careful not to create a single point of failure and knowledge hoarding. 4. Discuss post-implementation risks, including their likelihood, organizational impact, and mitigation. Data leaks can be due to carelessness or maliciousness, employees may accidentally put data in a publicly accessible space, or it may be available to other tenants in a shared cloud environment. The likelihood of this happening is low since sensitive data is available only to a limited number of individuals with additional training. However, if there is a data leak, the impact would be high due to the nature of the information being leaked and the potential civil penalties imposed by regulatory agencies. A data breach is another one of the common threats facing cloud infrastructure, usually through an insecure API. (Chinnasamy, 2021) Azure API Management feature can be leveraged to mitigate the risk associated with unsecured API. Token Validation, Claims Based Authorization, IP Restrictions, Request and Response Validation, etc., are all part of Azure API Management. (Microsoft, n.d.-b) Due to these strategies and additional awareness training, the 11 risk of a data breach is low. However, the impact would be high due to reputational damage and civil penalties imposed by the regulatory agency if the company did not take all possible measures to protect customer data. 5. Explain how the security solution meets each of the project stakeholder needs, including a description of the stakeholder needs. IT Staff are now presented with a cloud infrastructure to manage, which has updated infrastructure with current patches and updates. They are responsible for managing and securing the environment on a daily basis. However, the task is achievable as opposed to trying to secure an environment that the manufacturer no longer supports as it was in the on-premise environment. Adding hardware to the environment is almost instantaneous once management approves and payment is made. Maintaining proper configuration of the cloud procurements with the help of engineers, however, is still a requirement. Engineers have the benefit of working with cloud infrastructure and designing proper security solutions for the environment. In the on-premise environment, engineers were forced to come up with band-aid solutions due to outdated hardware and software. Current solutions can improve security and enhance user experience simultaneously instead of choosing one over the other. Solutions can be tested in a temporary cloud environment if needed based on budgetary allowance before code deployment, and incremental changes can be made, providing a better transition experience for regular customers. General users often experienced latency in the on-premise environment but have a better experience in the cloud environment. The user interface is intuitive, and many often viewed faster response time as a reflection of the services they would be receiving on their visit. This has 12 increased requests for appointments by existing customers and gained additional customers as a result of search engine optimization and the first impression of new visitors to the website and scheduling portal. a. Analyze how the changes resulting from the new solution affect stakeholders. Changes due to migration to the cloud infrastructure were positively received by IT Staff, engineers, and customers. Gaining new customers based on ease of scheduling an appointment alone shows that migration to cloud infrastructure has been a success for customers. Vulnerability reports and configuration reports are almost instantaneous for engineers and IT staff, leveraging the business intelligence and analysis service offered in the Azure environment. This results in better solutions being developed by engineers and better configuration management by IT Staff. G. Describe the post-implementation maintenance plan for the solution. Microsoft automatically conducts maintenance, such as updates and patches in the Azure infrastructure. No impact or least impact updates are applied with less than 30 seconds of interruption. A 35-day period is allocated for any non-urgent patches requiring a reboot of the virtual machine. IT Staff can choose when this reboot happens based on the least usage time periods referencing historical trends of usage. (Microsoft, 2022a) Any changes to the existing configuration and code will be managed through change management procedures and extensive testing to mitigate service interruption. One of the most important aspects of maintaining the cloud environment is paying bills to the cloud provider. All monies owed to the cloud provider will be paid a year in advance to ensure that any last-minute hiccups will not cause an 13 interruption. This will give one year for management to work out budgetary issues and to pay it forward should there be any potential for issues. H. Describe the cybersecurity domain from the attached “List of Cybersecurity Domains” that your solution addresses. Threat intelligence and collaboration happen based on intelligence feed and reports through sentinel, the built-in security information and event management solution in Azure. Indicators of Compromise and Indicators of Attack are based on observations in data feeds from various platforms. Engineers can add the threat indicators as it applies to a solution and aggregate them to enhance reporting from various threat intelligence platforms. Some of these non-Microsoft feeds can be well integrated into sentinel following but not limited to; Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence, Anomali, IBM X-Force, and Agari Phishing Defense and Brand Protection. (Microsoft, 2023c) Microsoft also provides useful pre-built templates based on domain, email, file hash, and IP address for customers to create their own analytical rules, making the process much faster. Customers can also build these rules from scratch based on their needs. Information is then visualized through a service called Microsoft Azure Workbooks. Key information about threats is provided in the Workbook, with cloud customers having the freedom to customize what is essential to them. (Microsoft, 2022a) IT Staff and engineers can take advantage of these visualizations to convey important information to management with the higher impact that usually comes with visualizing data. I.

Okay, so I have no idea what to do my project on. I want it to be something related to pentesting. I don't want to do anything real world where I have to deal with disclosure or legal issues. Help me refine a good project idea
```

  
Pentesting projects can be fascinating and educational. To avoid legal issues and disclosure concerns, let's focus on a simulated or controlled environment. Here are some project ideas related to pentesting:

1. **Vulnerable Web Application Testing**: Set up a vulnerable web application (e.g., OWASP WebGoat, DVWA) and perform a comprehensive pentest. Document your findings, exploits, and recommendations for remediation.
    
2. **Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge**: Participate in a CTF challenge (e.g., Hack The Box, TryHackMe) and document your approach, tools used, and solutions to the challenges.
    
3. **Simulated Network Pentest**: Create a virtual network with intentional vulnerabilities (e.g., Metasploitable, VulnHub) and conduct a pentest. Analyze your findings and provide recommendations for network hardening.
    
4. **Tool Development or Extension**: Choose an existing pentesting tool (e.g., Nmap, Burp Suite) and develop a new feature or plugin to enhance its capabilities.
    
5. **Pentesting Methodology Comparison**: Research and compare different pentesting methodologies (e.g., OSSTMM, PTES) and create a comprehensive report on their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.
    
6. **Vulnerability Research and Exploitation**: Select a specific vulnerability (e.g., CVE-XXXX-XXXX) and research its exploitation techniques. Create a proof-of-concept exploit and document your findings.
    
7. **Pentesting Automation**: Develop a script or tool to automate specific pentesting tasks (e.g., reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning) using languages like Python or PowerShell.
    
8. **Simulated Red Team Engagement**: Set up a simulated environment and conduct a red team engagement, where you play the role of an attacker trying to breach the network or system.
    

Pick the idea that resonates with you the most, or feel free to mix and match elements to create a project that suits your interests and skills. Good luck with your project!

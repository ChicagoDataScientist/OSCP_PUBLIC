# Lab:Â SQL injection UNION
The goal is to find how many columns are in the SQL Table

[Click here for lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns)

First, access the target web page in the Burpsuite Browser

Click on a category to create an sql query. Here, I selected "gifts"

Here is the "gifts" page

RIght click on that and select "send to repeater"

add a single quote ' to see if there is an sql injection vulnerability

Here you see the error you are looking for




Now, test to see how many columns are in the sql table:  We enter ```
```
Gifts'+UNION+SELECT+NULL-- HTTP/2
```

We replace space with + for the web query.

We see we did not get the right amount of columns because we get a 500 error.  We will try to add another column to our query.

![[Pasted image 20240612152343.png]]

We still get the same error. Two columns is not enough.  We need to try again!

![[Pasted image 20240612152504.png]]

We get an "HTTP OK" with three NLL columns.  We have solved the lab!

When we render the page, we see we have broken in to the sql code!

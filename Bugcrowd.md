# Bugcrowd

[Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/) fancies itself as a tool that helps security researchers find vulnerabilities that other security tools often miss. They can do this by using a series of teams that are matched with projects according to their skills, experience and availability.  

As a security researcher keen to find paying gigs, you can find a signup page [here](https://bugcrowd.com/user/sign_up). Unfortunately, there is no information about the average amounts that Bugcrowd pays on the site, but this [blog post](https://www.bugcrowd.com/blog/daily-payouts-greater-payments-flexibility-more-with-bugcrowd/) covers many of the FAQs about payments.
